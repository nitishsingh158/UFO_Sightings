# UFO Sightings Webpage Using JavasScript 

## Overview of the project
The purpose of the project is to create an interactive webpage that takes in user input and filters data and builds a table to show the results. The project uses JavaScript behind the HTML interface to detect user input and carry out the data filtering. 

### Results
The webpage provides the following:
 - A reset button on the top left of the page labelled "UFO Sightings". 
 - An article title and article body with news content regarding UFO sightings.
 - Filter Search Area that filters UFO sightings based on Data, City, State, Country and Shape.

### Summary
The following are a few drawbacks of the current webpage and provide a way to improve the user experience :
- Add a reset button below the filter options table. 
- Filter results on capitalized as well as lower case letters. 
- provide a dropdown of all filter options with a pop-up calendar for the date filter option.
